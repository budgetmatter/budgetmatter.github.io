        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Congressional budget actions may be classified according to three distinct types
          of measures involved: </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <b>
            <li class="list-group-item"> 1. Adoption of a budget resolution; the steps associated with this action
              commonly are referred to as the “congressional budget process”; </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> 2. Passage of the annual appropriations bills, including regular, supplemental,
              and continuing appropriations measures; </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> 3. passage of other legislation affecting the federal budget, such as
              authorizing legislation, reconciliation bills, and measures changing tax law, modifying entitlement
              programs, or adjusting the debt limit. The budget resolution is Congress’s main procedure for linking
              these different types of measures. </li>
          </b>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> The Congress begins its work on its budget resolution shortly after it receives
          the President’s Budget. Under the procedures established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Congress
          decides on budget targets before commencing action on individual appropriations. The Act requires each
          standing committee of the House and Senate to recommend budget levels and report legislative plans concerning
          matters within the committee’s jurisdiction to the Budget Committee in each body. The House and Senate Budget
          Committees then each design and report, and each body then considers, a concurrent resolution on the budget.
          The congressional timetable calls for the House and Senate to resolve differences between their respective
          versions of the congressional budget resolution and adopt a single budget resolution by April 15 of each year.
          In the report on the budget resolution, the Budget Committees allocate the total on budget authority and
          outlays set forth in the resolution to the Appropriations Committees and the other committees that have
          jurisdiction over spending. These committee al locations are commonly known as “302(a)” allocations, in
          reference to the section of the Congressional Budget Act that provides for them. The Appropriations Committees
          are then required to divide their 302(a) allocations of bud get authority and outlays among their
          subcommittees. These subcommittee allocations are known as “302(b)” al locations. There are procedural hurdles
          associated with considering appropriations bills that would breach or further breach an Appropriations
          subcommittee’s 302(b) allocation. Similar procedural hurdles exist for considering legislation that would
          cause the 302(a) allocation for any committee to be breached or further breached. The Budget Committees’
          reports may discuss assumptions about the level of funding for major programs. While these assumptions do not
          bind the other committees and subcommittees, they may influence their decisions.</p>

        <img id="imageR7" src="img/congressenacttimeline.PNG" alt="">

        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Budget resolutions may include “reserve funds,” which permit adjustment of the
          resolution allocations as necessary to accommodate legislation addressing specific matters, such as healthcare
          or tax reform. Reserve funds are most often limited to legislation that is deficit neutral, including
          increases in some areas offset by decreases in others. The budget resolution may also contain “reconciliation
          directives”. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> The budget submission includes the following volumes: </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Since the concurrent resolution on the budget is not a law, it does not require
          the President’s approval. However, the Congress considers the President’s views in preparing budget
          resolutions, because legislation developed to meet congressional budget allocations does require the
          President’s approval. In some years, the President and the joint leadership of Congress have formally agreed
          on plans to reduce the deficit or balance the budget. These agreements were then reflected in the budget
          resolution and legislation passed for those years. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> If the Congress does not pass a budget resolution, the House and Senate typically
          adopt one or more “deeming resolutions” in the form of a simple resolution or as a pro vision of a larger
          bill. A deeming resolution may serve nearly all functions of a budget resolution, except it may not trigger
          reconciliation procedures in the Senate. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Once the Congress approves the budget resolution, it turns its attention to
          enacting appropriations bills and authorizing legislation. The Appropriations Committee in each body has
          jurisdiction over annual appropriations. These committees are divided into subcommittees that hold hearings
          and review detailed budget justification materials prepared by the Executive Branch agencies within the
          subcommittee’s jurisdiction. After a bill has been drafted by a subcommittee, the full committee and the whole
          House, in turn, must approve the bill, sometimes with amendments to the original version. The House then
          forwards the bill to the Senate, where a similar review follows. If the Senate disagrees with the House on
          particular matters in the bill, which is often the case, the two bodies form a conference committee
          (consisting of some Members of each body) to resolve the differences. The conference committee revises the
          bill and returns it to both bodies for approval. When the revised bill is agreed to, first in the House and
          then in the Senate, the Congress sends it to the President for approval or veto. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> The Congress also provides budget authority in laws other than appropriations
          acts. In fact, while annual appropriations acts fund the majority of Federal programs, they account for only
          about a third of the total spending in a typical year. Authorizing legislation controls the rest of the
          spending, which is commonly called “mandatory spending.” A distinctive feature of these authorizing laws is
          that they provide agencies with the authority or requirement to spend money without first requiring the
          Appropriations Committees to enact funding. This category of spending includes interest the Government pays on
          the public debt and the spending of several major programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, un
          employment insurance, and Federal employee retirement. Almost all taxes and most other receipts also result
          from authorizing laws. Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution provides that all bills for raising revenue
          shall originate in the House of Representatives. In the House, the Ways and Means Committee initiates tax
          bills; in the Senate, the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over tax laws. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> The budget resolution often includes reconciliation directives, which require
          authorizing committees to recommend changes in laws that affect receipts or mandatory spending. They direct
          each designated committee to report amendments to the laws under the committee’s jurisdiction that would
          achieve changes in the levels of receipts or reductions in mandatory spending controlled by those laws. These
          directives specify the dollar amount of changes that each designated committee is expected to achieve, but do
          not specify which laws are to be changed or the changes to be made. However, the Budget Committees’ reports on
          the budget resolution frequently discuss assumptions about how the laws would be changed. Like other
          assumptions in the report, they do not bind the committees of jurisdiction but may influence their decisions.
          A reconciliation instruction may also specify the total amount by which the statutory limit on the public debt
          is to be changed. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> The committees subject to reconciliation directives draft the implementing
          legislation. Such legislation may, for example, change the tax code, revise benefit formulas or eligibility
          requirements for benefit programs, or authorize Government agencies to charge fees to cover some of their
          costs. Reconciliation bills are typically omnibus legislation, combining the legislation submitted by each
          reconciled committee in a single act. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Such a large and complicated bill would be difficult to enact under normal
          legislative procedures because it usually involves changes to tax rates or to popular social programs,
          generally to reduce projected deficits. The Senate considers such omnibus reconciliation acts under expedited
          procedures that limit total debate on the bill. To offset the procedural advantage gained by expedited
          procedures, the Senate places significant restrictions on the substantive content of the reconciliation
          measure itself, as well as on amendments to the measure. Any material in the bill that is extraneous or that
          contains changes to the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance programs
          is not in order under the Senate’s expedited reconciliation procedures. Nongermane amendments are also
          prohibited. The House does not allow reconciliation bills to increase mandatory spending in net, but does
          allow such bills to increase deficits by reducing revenues. Reconciliation acts, together with appropriations
          acts for the year, are usually used to implement broad agreements between the President and the Congress on
          those occasions where the two branches have negotiated a comprehensive budget plan. Reconciliation acts have
          sometimes included other matters, such as laws providing the means for enforcing these agreements. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Since 1977, when the start of the fiscal year was established as October 1, there
          have been only three fiscal years (1989, 1995, and 1997) for which the Congress agreed to and enacted every
          regular appropriations bill by that date. When one or more appropriations bills has not been agreed to by this
          date, the Congress usually enacts a joint resolution called a “continuing resolution’’ (CR), which is an
          interim or stopgap appropriations bill that provides authority for the affected agencies to continue
          operations at some specified level until a specific date or until the regular appropriations are enacted.
          Occasionally, a CR has funded a portion or all of the Government for the entire year. </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> The Congress must present these CRs to the President for approval or veto. In some
          cases, Congresses have failed to pass a CR or Presidents have rejected CRs because they contained unacceptable
          provisions. Left without funds, Government agencies were required by law to shut down operations—with
          exceptions for some limited activities—until the Congress passed a CR the President would approve. Shutdowns
          have lasted for periods of a day to several weeks. </p>
